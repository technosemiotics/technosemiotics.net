With recent developments, tech tools called "AI" are more visible and discussed than ever before. The discourses depicting AI as anthropomorphic characters and inviting to consider the apocalypse, however, distract from a range of current issues involving the unethical use of workforce and environmental resources in building today's technologies, hidden labour and epistemic injustices in deploying them, etc.

This session hosts a discussion on AI with the focus on how to make humans, their work and agency more visible in these complex sociotechnical systems, and to find ways to make an impact to this direction on the general media discourse on AI.
