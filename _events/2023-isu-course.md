Technology has a long-standing and seemingly increasing role in contemporary society. Increasing automation of various societal and work processes has an impact on almost every life. In media discourse, these changes are often discussed under the mystical label “artificial intelligence” which is used to describe various different processes, systems, devices, and ideas.

– What is behind the buzzword ‘AI’?   
– How is the meaning of AI constituted in a dialogue with culture and society?   
– What is the impact of our long-term historical and cultural legacies on the conception and adoption of AI systems?   
– What is the impact of these systems, as they are constructed today, on our society?   
– How do synthetic media function in culture?
