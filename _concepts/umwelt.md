Uexküll’s concept of Umwelt proposes that every species inhabits a unique “world” that is constructed based on their own abilities to create and interpret signs. These signs are shaped by their sensory organs and nervous system, which vary greatly between different species. For instance, the sensory apparatus of a fly for creating and receiving signs is vastly different from that of a human. (Cobley 2010: 4)

> “Territory is a pure Umwelt problem. It is an entirely subjective product, for even the closest knowledge of the environment does not give the slightest clue as to its existence.” (Uexküll 1992: 365-366)
