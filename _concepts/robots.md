#### social perception of robots

“[m]ost people’s conception of what a robot is appears to be largely based on the way robots are depicted in fiction” + “robots in fiction are largely presented as independent, autonomous actors that have a ‘mind of their own’, with a humanoid or anthropomorphic appearance” (Harbers, Peeters, and Neerincx 2017: 20).
