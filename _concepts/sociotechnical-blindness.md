> “Absence of discussion of the role played by programmers and other human actors in creating AI is another problem in current AI discourse that leads to misunderstanding and fear. What we call sociotechnical blindness, i.e. blindness to all of the human actors involved and all of the decisions necessary to make AI systems, allows AI researchers to believe that AI systems got to be the way they are without human intervention. As with confusion about autonomy, this blindness facilitates futuristic thinking that is misleading.”
(Johnson & Verdicchio 2017: 586)
