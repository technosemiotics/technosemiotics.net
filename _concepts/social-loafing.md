“Contrary to conventional wisdom, having a human in the loop in decision-making tasks does not appear to alleviate automation bias. Instead, human-machine collaboration in monitoring and sharing responsibility for decision-making can lead to similar psychological effects that occur when humans share responsibilities with other humans, whereby ‘social loafing’ arises – the tendency of humans to seek ways to reduce their own effort when working redundantly within a group than when they work individually on a task.” (Johnson 2022: 445)
