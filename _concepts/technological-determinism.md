> “…the view that material forces, and especially the properties of available technologies, determine social events. […] the central idea us that technological changes force social adaptations, and consequently constrain the trajectories of history.” (Sismondo 2010: 96)

> “Determinism inhibits the development of democratic controls on technology because it suggests that all interventions are futile. This is as true for science as it is for technology(Bijker, 1985; Collins and Pinch, 1993).” (Bijker 1995: 281)
