> “An AI system consists of a computational artefact together with the human behaviour and people who make the artefact a useful and meaningful entity. […] Sociotechnical ensembles are combinations of artefacts, human behaviour, social arrangements and meaning. For any computational artefact to be used for a real-world purpose, it has to be embedded into some context in which there are human beings that work with the artefact to accomplish tasks.” (Johnson and Verdicchio, 2017, 583; Bijker 1995)
