title: electronic brain metaphor
---

> “The ‘electronic brain’ has proven to be a product of 20th century mythology. But, myths die hard. The appalling ignorance of computer functions evidenced by the editors of the daily press, combined with the affinity for science fiction headlines, have been chief factors in keeping a confused image of the electronic computer in the public mind. Constant use of such terms as ‘electronic brain’ and ‘thinking machine’ have only served to promote the computer as a modern ‘Frankenstein’s Monster’ designed to replace man’s mind and his livelihood.”
